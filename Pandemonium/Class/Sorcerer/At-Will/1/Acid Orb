This version has you click on the enemy to display the name of your target.  Which helps avoid misunderstandings, and is a great help if you're playing without a microphone.

@{EncAttack} is for Encounter long attack buffs.  Default 0.
@{EncDamage} is for Encounter long damage buffs.  Default 0.
AttackAdds is a ability macro for a power menu exclusively comprised of thing which work directly after an attack.  Links to things like "Coin of Good Luck", Lighning Weapon's daily power, etc.
@{CritNote} is where you put in anything unusual that happens when you crit.  Like it's always lighting, or it prones, etc.
The reason I've split ChaImpDamage & ImpDamage is because I had some damage instances that didn't include a stat mod, and this makes that easy.
